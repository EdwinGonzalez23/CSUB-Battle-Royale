## CSUB Battle Royale
About: This is a game inspired by battle royale video games.
A character is spawned in the middle of the map and must take out a group of AI enemies.
The player can collect different guns and must fight a boss at the end.

Technologies/Languages: C++, OpenGl, custom/stock art assets

My Role: Focused on building the physics system. This consisted of bullet mechanics, wall collisions, enemy AI, movement, spawn mechanics, and other minor features.
